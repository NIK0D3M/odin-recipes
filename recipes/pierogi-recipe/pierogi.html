    <h2> Pierogi Recipe </h2>
    <p>
      Pierogi are traditional Polish dumplings, made from unleavened dough and stuffed with various fillings like potato,
      cheese, meat, or fruit. They can be boiled, pan-fried, or baked and are often served with sour cream or caramelized onions.

      <ol>

        <h3> <strong> Prepare the Ingredients </strong> </h3>
        <li> Boil 500 g of potatoes until soft, then mash and let them cool. </li>
        <li> Finely chop 1 medium onion and sauté it in 1 tablespoon of butter until golden brown. </li>
        <li> Crumble 250 g of farmer's cheese. </li>
        <li> Measure 400 g of flour, 200 ml of warm water, and 1 egg for the dough. </li>
        <li> Prepare salt and pepper for seasoning the filling. </li>
        
        <h3> <strong> Make the Dough </strong> </h3>
        <li> In a large bowl, mix the flour, egg, a pinch of salt, and warm water until the dough comes together. </li>
        <li> Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. </li>
        <li> Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20-30 minutes. </li>
        
        <h3> <strong> Prepare the Filling </strong> </h3>
        <li> In a large bowl, mix the mashed potatoes, crumbled cheese, and sautéed onions. </li>
        <li> Season the filling with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
        <li> Mix well until the filling is smooth and uniform. </li>
        
        <h3> <strong> Assemble the Pierogi </strong> </h3>
        <li> Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a thin sheet (about 2 mm thick). </li>
        <li> Use a round cutter (or a glass) to cut circles from the dough. </li>
        <li> Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of each circle. </li>
        <li> Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape and press the edges firmly to seal. </li>
        <li> Optionally, crimp the edges for a decorative finish. </li>
        
        <h3> <strong> Cook the Pierogi </strong> </h3>
        <li> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. </li>
        <li> Add the pierogi in batches and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface. </li>
        <li> Remove the pierogi with a slotted spoon and drain well. </li>
        
        <h3> <strong> Serve </strong> </h3>
        <li> Serve the pierogi warm with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh dill or chives. </li>
        <li> Optionally, top with caramelized onions or fry the boiled pierogi in butter for a crispy finish. </li>
